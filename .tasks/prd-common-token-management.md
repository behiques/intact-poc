# Product Requirements Document: Common Token Management Feature

## Introduction/Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation of a centralized token management system within a new `common` feature. The system will handle authentication token retrieval, storage, and automatic refresh for all backend API requests. This feature ensures that all API calls to the backend are properly authenticated without requiring manual token management from individual features or components.

**Problem Statement:** Currently, there is no centralized way to manage authentication tokens for backend API calls, which could lead to inconsistent authentication handling and potential security issues.

**Goal:** Implement a robust, transparent token management system that automatically handles token retrieval, storage, expiration detection, and refresh for all backend API communications.

## Goals

1. **Centralized Authentication:** Provide a single source of truth for authentication tokens across the entire application
2. **Automatic Token Management:** Implement auto-refresh functionality based on token expiration detection
3. **Transparent Operation:** Handle token management without user intervention or visible loading states
4. **Secure Storage:** Store tokens securely and clear them appropriately on session end
5. **Error Resilience:** Handle token retrieval failures gracefully while maintaining application stability
6. **Backend Integration:** Ensure all backend API calls are automatically authenticated

## User Stories

1. **As a developer**, I want all my backend API calls to be automatically authenticated so that I don't need to manually handle token management in each feature.

2. **As a developer**, I want tokens to be automatically refreshed when they expire so that API calls don't fail due to authentication issues.

3. **As a system administrator**, I want authentication to be configurable via environment variables so that different environments can use different authentication endpoints and system IDs.

4. **As a user**, I want authentication failures to be handled transparently so that my experience isn't interrupted by authentication-related errors.

5. **As a security-conscious stakeholder**, I want tokens to be stored securely and cleared when sessions end so that authentication credentials don't persist unnecessarily.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Environment Configuration**
   - The system must support an `AUTH_TOKEN_API_URL` environment variable for the authorization endpoint
   - The system must support a `BACKEND_API_URL` environment variable for backend API calls
   - The system must support a `USER_SYSTEM_ID` environment variable for the static system identifier

2. **Token Retrieval**
   - The system must make HTTP requests to the authorization API with the following headers:
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
     - `usersystemid: <USER_SYSTEM_ID from env>`
   - The system must handle the expected response format:
     ```json
     {
       "token": "eru488hsdgwervwerv...",
       "expiration": "Monday, July 28, 2025 1:50 PM"
     }
     ```

3. **Token Storage**
   - The system must store retrieved tokens securely in browser storage
   - The system must clear tokens when the session ends
   - The system must persist tokens across page refreshes during active sessions

4. **Token Expiration Management**
   - The system must decode tokens to extract expiration information
   - The system must automatically refresh tokens before they expire
   - The system must handle token refresh without user intervention

5. **API Integration**
   - The system must automatically attach valid tokens to all backend API requests
   - The system must ensure backend API calls use the `BACKEND_API_URL` environment variable
   - The system must retry failed requests after token refresh (if the failure was due to expiration)

6. **Error Handling**
   - The system must handle authorization API failures gracefully
   - The system must return appropriate error states for non-expiration-related failures
   - The system must not display authentication errors to end users
   - The system must log authentication failures for debugging purposes

7. **Common Feature Structure**
   - The system must follow the established feature-based architecture
   - The system must provide hooks for token management
   - The system must provide API utilities for authenticated requests
   - The system must include comprehensive TypeScript types

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

1. **User Authentication UI:** This feature does not include login/logout user interfaces
2. **User Session Management:** This feature does not handle user session state beyond token storage
3. **Multiple Token Types:** This feature only handles a single authentication token type
4. **Token Sharing Across Tabs:** Cross-tab token synchronization is not required
5. **Offline Token Management:** Token handling during offline scenarios is not included
6. **Custom Token Validation:** Beyond expiration detection, custom token validation is not required
7. **User-Visible Error States:** Authentication errors should not be displayed to users

## Design Considerations

1. **Hook-Based API:** Provide React hooks for easy integration with existing components
2. **TypeScript Support:** Include comprehensive type definitions for all token-related operations
3. **Testing Strategy:** Ensure all token management logic is thoroughly tested
4. **Performance:** Minimize API calls through intelligent caching and refresh timing
5. **Security:** Follow security best practices for token storage and transmission

## Technical Considerations

1. **Environment Variables:** Add new environment variables to `.env.example` and configuration
2. **Token Decoding:** Implement JWT decoding for expiration detection (without signature verification)
3. **Storage Strategy:** Use secure browser storage (localStorage/sessionStorage) with session clearing
4. **API Client Integration:** Integrate with existing TanStack Query setup for automatic token attachment
5. **Error Boundaries:** Ensure authentication failures don't crash the application
6. **Retry Logic:** Implement intelligent retry mechanisms for token refresh scenarios

## Success Metrics

1. **API Authentication Coverage:** 100% of backend API calls should be automatically authenticated
2. **Token Refresh Success Rate:** >99% success rate for automatic token refresh operations
3. **Error Handling:** Zero user-visible authentication errors under normal operation
4. **Performance Impact:** Token management should add <100ms overhead to API calls
5. **Developer Experience:** Developers should not need to handle authentication manually in features
6. **Security Compliance:** No authentication tokens should persist after session end

## Open Questions

1. **Token Refresh Timing:** Should tokens be refreshed proactively (e.g., 5 minutes before expiration) or reactively?
2. **Concurrent Request Handling:** How should multiple simultaneous API calls be handled during token refresh?
3. **Development/Testing:** Should there be a mock token provider for development and testing environments?
4. **Migration Strategy:** How should existing features be migrated to use the new token management system?
5. **Monitoring:** Should token refresh failures be reported to monitoring/analytics services?
6. **Session Definition:** What constitutes a "session end" for token clearing purposes (browser close, tab close, explicit logout)?
